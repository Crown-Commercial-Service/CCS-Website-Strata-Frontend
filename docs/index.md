## Routes

Routes are defined in `config/routes.yaml`

These define the URL path to match and the controller / action to run.

At present routes are manually created in Symfony.  

See https://symfony.com/doc/current/routing.html

## Controllers

Controllers are saved in `src/Controller/` 

## Templates

Templates are saved in `templates/`

[Twig](https://twig.symfony.com/) is used as the template engine, a simple and powerful template engine.
